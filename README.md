# A Journey Into C++

Welcome to my C++ adventure! In this repository, I’ve gathered all the cool stuff I've learned while diving into the C++ programming language. Here’s a quick rundown of the key concepts I’ve explored:

## 1. The Basics: Classes, Variables, and Methods

We kicked things off with the essentials: creating **classes**, defining **variables**, and writing **methods**. This was all about understanding how to organize and manipulate data in a structured way using classes.

## 2. New and Delete, Pointers, and References

Next up, we ventured into **memory management**. I learned how to use `new` and `delete` to allocate and free memory. Plus, we explored **pointers** and **references**—super helpful for accessing and managing data in memory. It’s like learning how to give directions to a specific place in memory!

## 3. Fixed numbers

Where precision is less important than performance operations on float require complex divisions and multiplications. In fixed-point, we use binary offsets (>> and <<), much faster on CPU and GPU.

## 4. Inheritance, Public, Private, and Protected

Here, we got into **inheritance** and how it allows us to create new classes that reuse the properties and methods of existing ones. We also played around with **public**, **private**, and **protected** to control access to our class data, so only the right people (or methods) can get to certain information.

## 5. Polymorphism

after inheritance here is polymorphism or creating a model and making it become what we want like in my project, an animal becomes a cat or a dog. But remember, all cats are animals, but not all animals are cats...

## 6. Try and Catch

Sometimes things go wrong—so, in this part, I learned about **exception handling** with **try** and **catch** blocks. It’s like putting up safety nets in case your program runs into any unexpected issues!

## 7. Templates

Templates are pretty awesome! They let us write **generic code** that works with any data type. Whether it’s a **function template** or a **class template**, I got to see how flexible C++ can be when writing reusable code.

## 8. Containers (Map, Vector, Deque, etc.)

And last but not least, we explored some of C++’s powerful **containers** like `std::map`, `std::vector`, and `std::deque`. These are super handy for storing and managing collections of data, and I learned how to pick the right one depending on what I need to do.

That’s a wrap on the major concepts I’ve covered so far! C++ is a deep and rich language, and this is just the beginning of the journey. Feel free to explore the code and dive deeper into any of these topics. Happy coding! 😊

### A note on C++9 and the Ford-Johnson Algorithm

In exercise 2 of cpp9 we are asked to implement Ford Johnson's algorithm in order to sort a sequence of ints, to help you see my work more clearly, you will find an explanation that I created on excaldraw. It is not error-free, but I think I have explained the main steps of the algorithm.

[excaldraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=wGgKH6fpi3Vj4oqB1tl1-,42FcUXCug8wzyCQmQ0w9EQ) for more details on my implementation and approach.
