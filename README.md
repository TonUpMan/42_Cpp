# A Journey Into C++

Welcome to my C++ adventure! In this repository, Iâ€™ve gathered all the cool stuff I've learned while diving into the C++ programming language. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of the key concepts Iâ€™ve explored:

## 1. The Basics: Classes, Variables, and Methods

We kicked things off with the essentials: creating **classes**, defining **variables**, and writing **methods**. This was all about understanding how to organize and manipulate data in a structured way using classes.

## 2. New and Delete, Pointers, and References

Next up, we ventured into **memory management**. I learned how to use `new` and `delete` to allocate and free memory. Plus, we explored **pointers** and **references**â€”super helpful for accessing and managing data in memory. Itâ€™s like learning how to give directions to a specific place in memory!

## 3. Inheritance, Public, Private, and Protected

Here, we got into **inheritance** and how it allows us to create new classes that reuse the properties and methods of existing ones. We also played around with **public**, **private**, and **protected** to control access to our class data, so only the right people (or methods) can get to certain information.

## 4. Try and Catch

Sometimes things go wrongâ€”so, in this part, I learned about **exception handling** with **try** and **catch** blocks. Itâ€™s like putting up safety nets in case your program runs into any unexpected issues!

## 5. Templates

Templates are pretty awesome! They let us write **generic code** that works with any data type. Whether itâ€™s a **function template** or a **class template**, I got to see how flexible C++ can be when writing reusable code.

## 6. Containers (Map, Vector, Deque, etc.)

And last but not least, we explored some of C++â€™s powerful **containers** like `std::map`, `std::vector`, and `std::deque`. These are super handy for storing and managing collections of data, and I learned how to pick the right one depending on what I need to do.

Thatâ€™s a wrap on the major concepts Iâ€™ve covered so far! C++ is a deep and rich language, and this is just the beginning of the journey. Feel free to explore the code and dive deeper into any of these topics. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š

### A note on C++9 and the Ford-Johnson Algorithm

Iâ€™m currently working on a more advanced concept in **C++9** where Iâ€™ve implemented **the Ford-Johnson algorithm**. This is part of my ongoing study of sorting algorithms, and Iâ€™ve included my perspective on how this algorithm works and how I implemented it in C++. You can find the related code in the folder `cpp9` of this repository.
